# android-bucketlist
An Android app built in Kotlin for an interactive local bucket list manager. 

Design Patterns included in this project:
- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Repository Pattern
- Data Access Objects (DAO) Pattern

Key Techniques Used:
- Local databases, DAO, and TypeConverters
- Multiple Fragments implemented with bindings and ViewModels
- Dialogs & Intents for sending data between fragments
- Recycler Views (and associated Adapters and Holders) for displaying many BucketList goals, or steps for individual goals
- Multiple Layouts for different orientations, using both LinearLayouts and ConstraintLayouts
- Taking and storing images to be used with specific goals


Built for my Mobile App Development course, taken for my MEng CSA degree at Virginia Tech (Fall 2024)
